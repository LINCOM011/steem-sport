# steem-sport
a sport application on steemit

> I am a sport lover, and i use this to unwind from time to time. I know sport stories are written on steemit, but finding them should be as easy as opening an app. The basic idea behind this app, is to allow anyone easily read relevant sport stories from steemit and contribute/write in a structured way, sport stories to steemit.

- This project is being actively developed. We'll be shipping several features in the coming days and i will be updating the readme.
